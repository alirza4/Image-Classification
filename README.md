- PyTorch Image Classification
This repository contains the implementation of two neural network architectures using PyTorch for classifying images in the CIFAR-10 dataset. The project includes a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) and a convolutional neural network (CNN), both trained to classify images into 10 different classes.



- Introduction
Image classification is a fundamental task in computer vision, aiming to categorize images into predefined classes or labels. This project explores two popular neural network architectures, MLP and CNN, for classifying images in the CIFAR-10 dataset.




- Dataset
The CIFAR-10 dataset consists of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes, with 6,000 images per class. The classes include common objects such as airplanes, automobiles, birds, cats, and more.
